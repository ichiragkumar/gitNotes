# GitNote 📝 + 🐙

> A GitHub-powered note-taking and task management tool that uses Issues and Repos to sync, tag, and notify users.

## ✨ Overview

GitNote is a developer-focused note-taking app that connects with your GitHub account, allowing you to:

- Authenticate with GitHub.
- Choose a repository to store your notes.
- Create and manage notes as files in the repository.
- Generate GitHub Issues for notes to enable tagging, assignment, and notifications.
- Control note visibility (public/private).
- Keep all notes synced with GitHub for backup and collaboration.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. **User Sign In**  
   User logs in using GitHub OAuth.

2. **Repo Access Permission**  
   After login, GitNote requests permission to access the user's repositories (public or private based on scope).

3. **Choose Repository**  
   The user selects one repo to store their notes (or GitNote creates a new one like `gitnote-notes`).

## 📁 Note Structure in Repository

Notes will be stored as markdown files in a `/notes` directory, with metadata like:

```yaml
---
title: "Meeting with Jane"
tags: ["meeting", "project-x"]
visibility: "private"
created_at: "2025-04-21"
---
Content goes here...
```

File path example: `notes/2025-04-21-meeting-with-jane.md`

## 🧩 GitHub Issue Integration

For each note:
- An optional GitHub Issue is created.
- The issue title = note title.
- Labels = note tags.
- The user (and assignees) get GitHub notifications.

## ⚙️ Feature Set

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔐 GitHub OAuth | Login using GitHub |
| 📂 Repo Selection | Choose repo for note storage |
| 📝 Markdown Notes | Create/edit notes as `.md` files |
| 🔒 Privacy Options | Public/Private note settings |
| 🏷️ Tagging | Add tags to notes |
| 🔔 Issue Notification | Send notifications via GitHub Issues |
| 🔄 Sync with GitHub | Notes are pushed to the repo automatically |

## 🧠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|------|------|
| Frontend | React + Tailwind (Vite preferred) |
| Backend | Node.js + Express (or NestJS for scalability) |
| GitHub API | REST + OAuth |
| Storage | GitHub Repo (for notes) |
| DB (optional) | MongoDB (for user config/preferences) |

## 🛠️ Setup Steps

### 1. GitHub OAuth App

- Register your app at: https://github.com/settings/developers
- Get your `client_id` and `client_secret`.
- Set scopes: `repo`, `user`, `write:issues`

### 2. Frontend

- User login page
- Repo selection modal
- Note editor (markdown with metadata support)
- Settings (visibility, assignees)

### 3. Backend API

- `/auth/github/callback` – handle OAuth callback
- `/repos` – list user repos
- `/notes` – create/update/delete notes
- `/issues` – create GitHub Issues

### 4. GitHub Integration

- Use Octokit SDK (recommended) to:
  - Fetch user data
  - Get repo list
  - Create/update files via the GitHub Content API
  - Create Issues with labels and assignees

## 🚧 Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 – MVP (Core)

- [ ] GitHub OAuth login
- [ ] Repo selection
- [ ] Basic note creation
- [ ] Save note as `.md` to GitHub repo

### Phase 2 – GitHub Issue Flow

- [ ] Create GitHub Issue per note
- [ ] Tag/assign issue for notification
- [ ] Link Issue to note

### Phase 3 – Privacy & Metadata

- [ ] Add visibility toggle
- [ ] Support YAML frontmatter
- [ ] Markdown editor UI

### Phase 4 – Dashboard & Sync

- [ ] Dashboard of notes (from GitHub)
- [ ] Sync latest notes
- [ ] Search & filter by tags/dates

## 📬 Notifications

By using GitHub Issues:
- Collaborators or assigned users get automatic GitHub notifications
- Great for remote teams, project notes, task delegation

## 🔐 Permissions & Security

- GitHub OAuth token is stored securely (server or client-side session)
- User can revoke access anytime from GitHub
- Notes are stored only in user-selected repos (not centralized DB)

## 💡 Future Ideas

- AI-generated summaries from notes
- GitHub Discussion integration
- Cross-repo note management
- Mobile PWA
